Boulder Dash Dream is a levelset with levels in the original Boulder Dash style. It's meant to let you revive the good old days. (But it's also enjoyable for those who didn't live then!) 

This set has some nice features, like:

* an own story
* a nostalgic atmosphere and a number of elements (a blowing wind, a picture of a castle, etc.) to intensify this atmosphere
* an introduction screen and an end screen with music and sound effects
* a new border and side panel
* and much more...

Many thanks to:

* First Star Software for their great game idea! Visit www.firststarsoftware.com and buy their games to keep supporting the development of Boulder Dash games!
* Alan Bond and Andreas Buschbeck for the BD graphics and fonts
* Holger Schemel for making Rocks'n'Diamonds. 

Have fun!
